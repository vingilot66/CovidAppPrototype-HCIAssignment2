## Sample App Prototype

I worked off of my base application that I created for my assignment 1 with tweaks that made it more user friendly.

Some of these changes were:

#### 1. Everything on one screen
I wanted to make sure that what the user wants is front and centre. My old home screen was a the map screen, it makes a lot more sense for the home screen to display all of the pages. This way users can instantly see all of their options and go directly to what they want.
