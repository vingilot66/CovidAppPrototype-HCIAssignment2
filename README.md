# CovidAppPrototype-HCIAssignment2
## Sample App Prototype

I worked off of my base application that I created for my assignment 1 with tweaks that made it more user friendly.

Some of these changes were:

#### 1. Ability to See Region Rules
No other application that I have found has the abilities to show what regulations are put in a certian
region. It is important for people to know restrictions are put in place before they make plans or
leave their house. For example, what stage is that area in, how many people can we have in a group,
do I have to wear a mask? This type of info is important to a lot of people.

#### 2. Easily Readable Map
A lot of the apps that I have found overlay their map way too heavily with graphics. A plain map with a few
not too dominant circles does the job fine. A Covid map that can't be seen through visuals isn't much use to
anyone. 

#### 3. Regional News
Most applications only offer news for countries or the world as a whole. It would be of great use to have local
news at your finger tips. For example if a neighborhood near you had an outbreak it would be the easiest way
to find out. 

#### 4. Key Features on Main Page
Everything is front and centre the moment you get past the login screen. The key features are displayed front and
center allowing the user to go straight to what they want to do.

#### 5. Updating Data
Alot of applications don't update their data very often, since the regional news is being recorded already it would
be easy to update the data as it comes in. If you have a map it shouldn't be that hard to update and generate tables
with that data.
